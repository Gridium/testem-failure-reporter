# Testem Failure Reporter

Report just the interesting part of a test run: the failures.

## Installation

    npm install testem-failure-reporter

## Usage

Create a `testem.js` config file that sets reporter to `testem-failure-reporter`:

````
var FailureReporter = require('testem-failure-reporter');
var reporter = new FailureReporter();

module.exports = {
  "framework": "qunit",
  "test_page": "tests/index.html?hidepassed&coverage",
  "disable_watching": true,
  "launch_in_ci": [
    "PhantomJS"
  ],
  "reporter": reporter
};
````

Run tests in an Ember CLI project, reporting only failures:

    ember test --config-file ~/work/project/testem.js

`bin/run-tests.js` is a sample script that uses 
(sane)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/sane] to watch the filesystem,
run tests on changes, parse he (blanket.js)[http://blanketjs.org/] coverage
report, and output test coverage changes.

    node_modules/testem-failure-reporter/bin/run-tests.js

## Notes

This currently doesn't work with `ember test --module some-module` because Ember CLI 
rewrites the `testem.json` file to accomplish this, and doesn't support the
`testem.js` file.
